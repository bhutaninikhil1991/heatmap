The Air Traffic Passenger Statistics dataset is described as:
San Francisco International Airport Report on Monthly Passenger Traffic Statistics by Airline. Airport data is seasonal in nature, therefore any comparative analyses should be done on a period-over-period basis (i.e. January 2010 vs. January 2009) as opposed to period-to-period (i.e. January 2010 vs. February 2010). It is also important to note that fact and attribute field relationships are not always 1-to-1. For example, Passenger Counts belonging to United Airlines will appear in multiple attribute fields and are additive, which provides flexibility for the user to derive categorical Passenger Counts as desired.

The original dataset includes over 21.k rows as of December 2019.The original dataset includes 12 columns. Most of these columns are categorical text, such as the operating airline and geographic region. The activity period is encoded as a number but may be wrangled to be interpreted as a date. The only other number is passenger count.
